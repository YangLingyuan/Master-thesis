 abstract = {This paper presents an investigation of how Model

Predictive Control (MPC) and weather predictions can

increase the energy efficiency in Integrated Room

Automation (IRA) while respecting occupant comfort. IRA

deals with the simultaneous control of heating,

ventilation and air conditioning as well as blind

positioning and electric lighting such that the room

temperature as well as CO2 and luminance levels stay

within given comfort ranges. MPC is an advanced control

technique which, when applied to buildings, employs a

model of the building dynamics and solves an optimization

problem to determine the optimal control inputs. The

result is an optimal plan in the sense that it takes into

account the future weather and internal gains and

controls the HVAC, light and blind units to minimize

energy costs while respecting comfort constraints.

Through a large-scale factorial simulation study we show

that MPC coupled with weather predictions is beneficial

in terms of energy efficiency and occupant comfort. In

particular, we investigate the control performance, the

impact of the accuracy of weather predictions as well as

the robustness and tunability of the control strategy.},

 abstract = {This article presents a comparison of commercial and model based predictive control strategies aimed at optimizing efficiency of classical heating systems used in greenhouse temperature control. Two kind of heating systems are considered: aerial pipes with hot water and air-fan heaters. By using simple linearized models of the system around the predefined setpoints and a generalized predictive control strategy, the performance is improved without requiring modifications in the heating systems. The main strength of this paper lies in the fact that the MPC algorithm has been tested in a greenhouse.},

@book{Rodriguez.2015,
 abstract = {A discussion of challenges related to the modeling and control of greenhouse crop growth, this book presents state-of-the-art answers to those challenges. The authors model the subsystems involved in successful greenhouse control using different techniques and show how the models obtained can be exploited for simulation or control design; they suggest ideas for the development of physical and/or black-box models for this purpose. Strategies for the control of climate- and irrigation-related variables are brought forward. The uses of PID control and feedforward compensators, both widely used in commercial tools, are summarized. The benefits of advanced control techniques-event-based, robust, and predictive control, for example-are used to improve on the performance of those basic methods. A hierarchical control architecture is developed governed by a high-level multiobjective optimization approach rather than traditional constrained optimization and artificial intelligence techniques.~ Reference trajectories are found for diurnal and nocturnal temperatures (climate-related setpoints) and electrical conductivity (fertirrigation-related setpoints). The objectives are to maximize profit, fruit quality, and water-use efficiency, these being encouraged by current international rules. Illustrative practical results selected from those obtained in an industrial greenhouse during the last eight years are shown and described. The text of the book is complemented by the use of illustrations, tables and real examples which are helpful in understanding the material. Modeling and Control of Greenhouse Crop Growth will be of interest to industrial engineers, academic researchers and graduates from agricultural, chemical, and process-control backgrounds. Advances in Industrial Control aims to report and encourage the transfer of technology in control engineering. The rapid development of control technology has an impact on all areas of the control discipline. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of new work in all aspects of industrial control},

MPC is an advanced control technique which, when applied to buildings, employs a model of the building dynamics and solves an optimization problem to determine the optimal control inputs. In this paper it is reported on the development and analysis of a Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) strategy for building climate control that takes into account the uncertainty due to the use of weather predictions.As first step the potential of MPC was assessed by means of a large-scale factorial simulation study that considered different types of buildings and HVAC systems at four representative European sites. Then for selected representative cases the control performance of SMPC, the impact of the accuracy of weather predictions, as well as the tunability of SMPC were investigated. The findings suggest that SMPC outperforms current control practice.



Highlights► Energy savings potential in buildings by using Model Predictive Control (MPC). ► New stochastic MPC strategy takes into account uncertainty in weather predictions. ► Stochastic MPC outperforms current control practice in terms of energy and comfort. ► For using stochastic MPC the quality of weather predictions is important. ► Stochastic MPC can be easily tuned by changing one parameter.},

@book{Ellis.2016,
 abstract = {This book presents general methods for the design of economic model predictive control (EMPC) systems for broad classes of nonlinear systems that address key theoretical and practical considerations including recursive feasibility, closed-loop stability, closed-loop performance, and computational efficiency. Specifically, the book proposes:Lyapunov-based EMPC methods for nonlinear systems;two-tier EMPC architectures that are highly computationally efficient; andEMPC schemes handling explicitly uncertainty, time-varying cost functions, time-delays and multiple-time-scale dynamics. The proposed methods employ a variety of tools ranging from nonlinear systems analysis, through Lyapunov-based control techniques to nonlinear dynamic optimization. The applicability and performance of the proposed methods are demonstrated through a number of chemical process examples. The book presents state-of-the-art methods for the design of economic model predictive control systems for chemical processes.In addition to being mathematically rigorous, these methods accommodate key practical issues, for example, direct optimization of process economics, time-varying economic cost functions and computational efficiency.Numerous comments and remarks providing fundamental understanding of the merging of process economics and feedback control into a single framework are included. A control engineer can easily tailor the many detailed examples of industrial relevance given within the text to a specific application. The authors present a rich collection of new research topics and references to significant recent work making Economic Model Predictive Controlan important source of information and inspiration for academics and graduate students researching the area and for process engineers interested in applying its ideas.  Dr. Liu received the BS and MS degrees in Control Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2003 and 2006, respectively. He received the PhD degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2011. Before joining the University of Alberta in April, 2012, Dr. Liu was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles. His research interests are in the general areas of process control theory and practice with emphasis on model predictive control, networked and distributed control, process monitoring, and real-time control of chemical processes and energy generation systems. Professor Panagiotis Christofides obtained his PhD from the University of Minnesota in 1996 and he has been a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles since 2004. He is a fellow of various professional societies: the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the International Federation of Automatic Control and the IEEE. He is the author of numerous research papers, as well as two previous books published by Springer and has much experience of conference organization having served on various boards at various times, among them as the AIChE Director on the American Automatic Control Council.},
